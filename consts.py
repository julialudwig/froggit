Constants for Froggit

This module contains global constants for the game Froggit. These constants need to be
used in the model, the view, and the controller. As these are spread across multiple
modules, we separate the constants into their own module. This allows all modules to
access them.

### USE COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS TO CHANGE DEFAULT LEVEL FILE AND FROG SPEED
"""
sys.argv is a list of the command line arguments when you run python. These arguments are
everything after the word python. So if you start the game typing

    python froggit default.json 1

Python puts ['froggit', 'default.json', '1'] into sys.argv. Below, we take advantage of
this fact to change the constant DEFAULT_LEVEL. This is the level file to be used when
you start the game.

The second argument is the FROG_SPEED, which is the amount of time between move steps.
A large value means a much slower moving frog.
